### A personal repository for William Chou's programming projects. ###

My name is [William Chou](http://www.williamchou.com), and I'm a Cornell University CS graduate. Here's a collection of current and past programming projects. All code is released under the new BSD license.

## Sample game code: ##

  * **[symptom](http://williamchou.com/release/symptom)**, an original 2D side-scroller game.
    * Learned Flash programming and wrote this over the course of a summer in college.

  * **[asteroids](http://williamchou.com/release/asteroids)**, a remake of the classic arcade game. Written as part of an interview process in 2009.
    * Features custom Flex UI components (a la Flex Component Kit), a self-tiling background and a simple particle system with object pooling.

  * **[minesweeper](http://williamchou.com/release/minesweeper)**, a clone of the popular desktop game. Written as part of an interview process in 2009.

## Other code: ##

  * **async\_dependency\_graph**, a utility class that provides elegant handling and execution of multiple asynchronous method calls with dependencies.

  * **graphics\_test**, a demo that compares Flash rendering methods and collision processing algorithms.

  * **array\_test**, a performance comparison between AS3.Vector and a linked list.
